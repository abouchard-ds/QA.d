## Pseudocode

Since this was created for learning/academic purpose I will add the pseudocode for a beginner who would like to understand the script and learn from it.

1. Ask user for username, password and start date
    * Validate input password since user can't see in field
    * Validate input that start date is less than yesterday.
2. Ask user where she wants to save the Dataset.CSV
3. Process variables from validated input to forge the URL and the Dataset.CSV
4. Create a ./tmp directory to put our temporary stock files during download
5. Validate that no Dataset file exists for today and create one
6. Read the stock parameter file (*tsx_minimal.ini*) into an array
7. Enter a loop for each stocks :
    * Gives the percentage of progress ```((index/arraySize)*100)``` this controls the zenity progress bar
    * Gives the current stock being downloaded ("# abc" insure zenity uses this echo in it's progress window)
    * Create a temporary stock file
    * Download data into the temporary stock file (wget)
    * Add the stock ticker at the beginning of each lines
    * Remove header and null from temporary stock file
    * Append the temporary file into the final Dataset.CSV
8. Delete all temporary stock file
9. Move the Dataset.CSV to the user specified location.
10. Display a dialog summarizing the job and confirming it has been completed.
