QA.D Downloader is a small bash script to automatically download historical data for stocks from Yahoo Finance (as data source) and format it as CSV file. It has a small GUI made with zenity. You can download historical data from anytime until yesterday at midnight. For the moment you will need to edit the *stock_config.ini* to select your own stocks.

This is the stepping stone to a greater project for a complete Quants solution from scratch.

## Features

## Installation
The program has been developed and tested on [Ubuntu 17.10 Desktop](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop). The following packages are used by the script. Nothing fancy, it was all default install on Ubuntu 17.10.

## Acknowledgments

This program was created as a simple exercise to practice bash with zenity. Most zenity features are tested in this script.

The dataset generated is still of good use since Yahoo blocked their Finance API.
