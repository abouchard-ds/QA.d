## Introduction

QA.D Downloader is a small bash script to automatically download historical data for stocks from Yahoo Finance (as data source) and format it as CSV file. It has a small GUI made with zenity. You can download historical data from anytime until yesterday at midnight. For the moment you will need to edit the *stock_config.ini* to select your own stocks. 

This is the stepping stone to a greater project for a complete Quants solution from scratch.
