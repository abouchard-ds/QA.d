QA.d (**Q**uantitative**A**nalysis**.d**ownloader) is a bash script to automatically download historical stock data from [Yahoo! Finance](https://login.yahoo.com/config/login?.intl=ca&.lang=en-CA&.src=finance&.done=https%3A%2F%2Fca.finance.yahoo.com%2F) (as data source) and format it as CSV file. It uses zenity to create a simple GUI. You can download historical data from anytime until yesterday at midnight (in the extent it is available on Y!Finance).

This program was made as *a learning instrument* for bash scripting; dialogs creation with zenity/whiptail; to learn about Github, Jekyll and the Kanban board functionality.

The datasets created with this program can become of a sizable amount. If you take all Canadian and American stocks without exclusion (debentures, warrants, etc.) **you could get approximately 2Gb to 5Gb of data**.

## Features

* Easily create variable size datasets **for free**
* Personalize your historical stock datasets
* Almost no dependencies, packages are default
* The GUI follows your personnal Linux theme
* A '*non graphical*' version is also available
* Who knows? You could become a millionnaire using your dataset to make financial decisions

## Installation

The program has been developed and tested on [Ubuntu 17.10 Desktop](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop). The following packages are used by the script. Nothing fancy, it was all default install on Ubuntu 17.10.

You'll need to have an account on Y! Finance to be able to download the data.
* [Yahoo! Finance Account](https://login.yahoo.com/config/login?.intl=ca&.lang=en-CA&.src=finance&.done=https%3A%2F%2Fca.finance.yahoo.com%2F)

| packages | description | explanation |
|--|--|--|
| bash 4.4.12 | GNU Bourne Again SHell | you need a new version because of the use of ```readarray``` |
| zenity 3.24.0 | Display graphical dialog boxes from shell scripts | only tested on this version |
| bc 1.06.95 | GNU bc arbitrary precision calculator language | only tested on this version |
| awk 4.1.4 | GNU awk, a pattern scanning and processing language | only tested on this version |
| wget 1.19.1 | retrieves files from the web | note that wget handles stuff with the cookies |

To validate if you have the prerequisites:
```bash
dpkg -l bash zenity bc gawk date wget
```

You should get a somewhat similar return:
```bash
$ dpkg -l bash zenity bc gawk date wget

## Dataset

As a data scientist, enthusiast or student having full knowledge of your dataset is important. The dataset created by QA.d could be described as:

- Data source : Yahoo! Finance Canada;
- Prices are described at the 6th decimal point;
- Prices currency is in CAD$;
- Date field is formated as : YYYY-MM-DD;
- Columns headers have been stripped from the dataset;
    - Insert ```TICKER,DATE,OPEN,HIGH,LOW,CLOSE,ADJ_CLOSE,VOLUME``` in first row if needed;
- Day were the stock markets are closed don't appear in the file;
- Line feed is Unix '\n';

Raw content example :
```
ZOM.V,2017-12-01,3.000000,3.100000,2.750000,2.750000,2.750000,51200
ZOM.V,2017-12-04,3.000000,3.000000,3.000000,3.000000,3.000000,1000

## Examples

If you use the provided *TSX_clean.ini* with a ```Start Date``` of 1971, you'll get a dataset of 251M containing 3,744,812 records on 1489 stocks. My runtime was 24 minutes for which half (~13 minutes) was for ```sleep```. I would not recommend removing the ```sleep```.

QAd_dataset.csv provided in the examples folder was generated on April 3 2018 using *"TSX_minimal.ini"* with a *"Start Date"* of March 26 2018.

Stocks.ini files provided for testing are:
- TSX_minimal.ini       (314  random stocks from TSX)
- TSX_clean.ini         (1489 stocks from the TSX)
- TSXV_clean.ini        (1522 stocks from the TSX Venture)
- TSX_TSXV_complete.ini (3011 stocks from TSX and TSXV)

**Stock types excluded**

My Stocks.ini files exclude most exotic ticker like ".PR." ".F." ".WT." ".DB.".

I won't explain here what are these types of stocks but you can read [this page on Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/university/stocks/stocks2.asp) for more information.

## Command_line

Usage of the command line script (*QAd_terminal.sh*) is:
```bash
$ ./QAd_terminal.sh "'user@yahoo'" "password" TSX_clean.ini
```
Note that the command line script don't ask for a start date. This is because the ```START DATE``` is always *GMT: Friday, January 1, 1971 12:00:00 AM* and the ```END DATE``` is *Today at midnight* thus downloading a full history for your parameter file. There's a sleep timer of 0.5 second between downloads which I find from experience does not lock my IP out of Yahoo.

Output looks like the following:
```bash
user@localhost:/github/data-scientia/QA.d $ ./QAd_terminal.sh "'user@yahoo'" "password" TSX_clean.ini

## Pseudocode

Since this was created for learning/academic purpose I will add the pseudocode for a beginner who would like to understand the script and learn from it.

1. Ask user for username, password and start date
    * Validate input password since user can't see in field
    * Validate input that start date is less than yesterday.
2. Ask user where she wants to save the Dataset.CSV
3. Process variables from validated input to forge the URL and the Dataset.CSV
4. Create a ./tmp directory to put our temporary stock files during download
5. Validate that no Dataset file exists for today and create one
6. Read the stock parameter file (*tsx_minimal.ini*) into an array
7. Enter a loop for each stocks :
    * Gives the percentage of progress ```((index/arraySize)*100)``` this controls the zenity progress bar
    * Gives the current stock being downloaded ("# abc" insure zenity uses this echo in it's progress window)
    * Create a temporary stock file
    * Download data into the temporary stock file (wget)
    * Add the stock ticker at the beginning of each lines
    * Remove header and null from temporary stock file
    * Append the temporary file into the final Dataset.CSV
8. Delete all temporary stock file
9. Move the Dataset.CSV to the user specified location.
10. Display a dialog summarizing the job and confirming it has been completed.

## Acknowledgments

This program was created as a simple exercise to practice bash with zenity.
Most zenity features are tested in this script.
This was created from scratch without researching other programs would could do the same (if my code looks like yours - that's a random occurence).
The dataset generated is still of good use since Yahoo blocked their Finance API.
