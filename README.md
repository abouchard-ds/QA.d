# QASMS Downloader v1.0

Historical Stock Market Data Downloader for Quantitative Analysis or general dataset creation in a data science context.

## Summary
QASMS_downloader (quantitative analysis stock market software) is a small bash script to automatically download historical data for stocks from Yahoo Finance (as data source) and format it as CSV file. It has a small GUI made with zenity. You can download historical data from the ~1960 until yesterday at midnight. It downloads the data per stock so I will add a stock picker window in the future. For the moment you will need to edit the array "arr" in the script to select your own stocks. 

**This is only the stepping stone to a greater project for complete Quants.**
